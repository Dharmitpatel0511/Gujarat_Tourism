                Boasting a 1600 km stretch, Gujarat's shoreline is the longest among India's nine seaside states' shores.If you have only been a witness to the intricate and historic landmarks of Gujarat, you are yet to explore the best through the expanse of Arabian Sea in the state. What makes these beaches even more beautiful is the fragrance of incense sticks blended in the breeze,coming from across the temples situated on these. The Somnath temple and Koteshwar Temple are instances of such amazing shore-side temples. The wind blows through the trees onshore, tapping and clicking the leaves together, while the sound of chanting mantras float from the nearby pilgrimage destinations.            </p>
